   * In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with more sophisticated
   * classical NLP processing techniques.

   * @param {string} input - The input text to be processed
   * @returns {string} The processed text (uppercase version of input)

   * const classicalModel = new ClassicalModel();

   * Role in overall program logic:
   * This function serves as a placeholder for classical text processing in the
   * Multi-Agent Organization (MOA) system. It demonstrates how a non-AI model
   * might be integrated into the larger system, providing a contrast to more
   * advanced AI-based models.

   * different types of models (classical vs. AI) within the system.
