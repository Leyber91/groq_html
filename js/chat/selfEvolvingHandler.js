/**
 * Main handler function for processing user input and generating responses.
 * This function serves as the entry point for the chat system's self-evolving logic.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * 1. Receives user input as a parameter.
 * 2. Calls handleUserInput to process the input and generate a response.
 * 3. Implements self-evolving logic (currently commented out).
 * 4. Returns the generated response or an error message if processing fails.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * const userMessage = "Hello, how are you?";
 * const botResponse = await mainHandler(userMessage);
 * console.log(botResponse);
 * 
 * Files that use this function:
 * - js/chat/chatInterface.js (likely entry point for chat interactions)
 * - js/api/endpoints.js (possibly used in API routes for chat functionality)
 * 
 * Role in overall program logic:
 * This function acts as the central hub for processing user inputs in the chat system.
 * It's responsible for coordinating the response generation and potential self-improvement
 * of the chat bot. The self-evolving aspect (when implemented) will allow the system
 * to learn and adapt based on user interactions.
 * 
 * @param {string} userInput - The input provided by the user
 * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves to the bot's response
