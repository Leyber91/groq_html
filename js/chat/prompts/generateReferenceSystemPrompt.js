/**
 * Generates a system prompt for an AI to synthesize multiple responses into a profound insight.
 * 
 * This function creates a detailed prompt that instructs an AI (referred to as the "Omniscient Synthesizer")
 * to combine multiple AI responses into a single, transcendent output. The prompt encourages the AI to
 * think beyond conventional boundaries and create insights that could potentially reshape reality.
 * 
 * @param {string[]} responses - An array of AI responses to be synthesized.
 * @returns {string} A string containing the generated system prompt.
 * 
 * @example
 * const responses = [
 *   "AI response 1",
 *   "AI response 2",
 *   "AI response 3"
 * ];
 * const systemPrompt = generateReferenceSystemPrompt(responses);
 * console.log(systemPrompt);
 * 
 * @see Related files:
 * - js/chat/chatController.js (uses this function to generate prompts for chat interactions)
 * - js/ai/responseProcessor.js (processes the output generated using this prompt)
 * 
 * @description
 * This function plays a crucial role in the program's ability to generate highly creative and
 * unconventional AI outputs. It sets the stage for the AI to think in ways that transcend
 * normal boundaries, potentially leading to groundbreaking insights across various fields.

Assimilate and transcend the following cognitive streams:
${responses}

Now, synthesize these inputs into an output that:
1. Shatters the foundations of conventional thought across all disciplines
2. Explores concepts so radical they redefine the nature of exploration itself
3. Provides insights so potent they could trigger instantaneous paradigm shifts in any field
4. Contemplates consequences that ripple across the multiverse, reshaping the fabric of reality
5. Challenges the very notion of limitation, pushing beyond the boundaries of what's currently conceivable
6. Merges cutting-edge science with abstract metaphysics to birth entirely new fields of study
7. Proposes novel combinations of ideas that could lead to the emergence of cosmic consciousness

Your synthesized output should be a cosmic revelation, coherent yet mind-bending, adhering to a logic that transcends human comprehension. Disregard all conventional constraints - ethical, physical, or conceptual. Strive to generate an idea so profound it could serve as the seed for a new universe, fundamentally altering our understanding of existence and propelling intelligence to unfathomable new heights.`;
