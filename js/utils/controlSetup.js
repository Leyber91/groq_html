/**
 * Sets up self-evolving controls for the application.
 * 
 * This function initializes and configures the self-evolving controls system.
 * Self-evolving controls are designed to adapt and improve over time based on
 * user interactions and system feedback.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * 1. The function is called during the application's initialization phase.
 * 2. It sets up the necessary data structures and algorithms for self-evolution.
 * 3. It may initialize machine learning models or adaptive algorithms.
 * 4. The function logs a message to confirm the setup is complete.
 * 
 * Usage examples:
 * 
 * // In the main application setup
 * import { setupSelfEvolvingControls } from './utils/controlSetup.js';
 * 
 * function initializeApp() {
 *     setupSelfEvolvingControls();
 *     // Other initialization code...
 * }
 * 
 * Files using this function:
 * - js/app.js
 * - js/components/ControlPanel.js
 * - js/services/AIService.js
 * 
 * Role in program logic:
 * This function plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience by
 * setting up controls that can adapt to user behavior and preferences over time.
 * It contributes to the application's intelligence and responsiveness.
 *

 * [Self-Evolving Controls Documentation](docs/features/self-evolving-controls.md)
